<p>Hey guys. And the <strong>Boltor Prime</strong> along with <a href="/primes/how-to-get-rhino-prime/" title="How To Get Rhino Prime">Rhino Prime</a> and <a href="/primes/how-to-get-ankyros-prime/" title="How To Get Ankyros Prime">Ankyros Prime</a> have been retired(vaulted) from the Warframe reward tables.</p><!--more--> <h2>Boltor Prime Vaulted</h2> <p>Now, if you've joined fairly recently there's a pretty good chance you have never experienced the vaulting. So, what it did is remove the relics that would drop parts for the Boltor Prime from the drop table. So, currently Boltor Prime is inaccessible for some period of time. An important thing to remember here though is that while Boltor Prime relics were moved over to the Prime Vault and made inaccessible, any relics that were acquired before these items were moved into the Prime Vault will stay.</p> <h2>How To Get Boltor Prime</h2> <p>So, first things first, check the presence of the following relics in your Void Relic Refinement:</p> <ul>  <li> <b>Neo B3, Lith B4</b> that drop Boltor Prime Blueprint </li>  <li> <b>Axi S3, Axi R1</b> that drop Boltor Prime Stock </li>  <li> <b>Lith B1, Neo R1</b> that drop Boltor Prime Receiver </li>  <li> <b>Meso M1, Meso N6</b> that drop Boltor Prime Barrel </li>  </ul> <p>If you don't have any of them then either you could buy Boltor Prime Relics from other players or wait until the Boltor Prime eventually returns when the Prime Vault opens again.</p> <p>And that’s pretty much all I want to say about <strong>How To Get Boltor Prime</strong>. I hope this guide helped and let's hope Boltor Prime will be unvaulted again soon. Bye-bye.</p>
